# The Pitch

**AIOps Substrate lets you own your digital sovereignty.**

**It replaces cloud dependence with absolute control.**

**It's what infrastructure looks like when you remove the middleman.**

---

## What Is It?

A self-hosted AI infrastructure platform that costs $0/month. Your hardware. Your data. Your control.

## What Does It Do?

- **Kubernetes foundation** that runs anywhere—laptop to datacenter
- **Automated certificate management** that just works—no more manual renewals
- **Enterprise-grade PKI**—your own certificate authority, military-grade security
- **Self-hosted LLM**—talk to your infrastructure in plain English, keep your data private
- **100% Infrastructure as Code**—reproducible, documented, no snowflakes

## The Problem

Companies burn thousands monthly on cloud bills they don't control. They rent AI models that read their data. They click through certificate warnings because PKI is "too hard."

## The Solution

One command. Production-ready cluster. Automated security. No PhD required.

## Why It Matters

The magic isn't the tech stack. It's that it **eliminates the complexity**.

This is infrastructure the way it should be.
